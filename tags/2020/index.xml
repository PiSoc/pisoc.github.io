      <description>Hi there, freshers of 2020! If you&amp;rsquo;ve not already been introduced, we&amp;rsquo;re Pi Society, but you can call us PiSoc. Our focus is on computer science (and occasionally maths and electrical engineering). We&amp;rsquo;re a motley crew of hackers, makers, technologists, and nerds.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a load of interesting events on the horizon. Part of the roadmap for this year is as follows:
 A trip to an as-of-yet-undecided destination to be chosen by you, the members of PiSoc Society projects - the university has greenlit us building them a magic mirror for public display CTF(Catch The Flag), a hacking Competitions where your objective is to find clues and complete the challenge Linux install parties - we&amp;rsquo;ll help you Linux-ify your laptop Gameathons - play video games Weekly meetings and socials We mainly use Discord but we are also planning on using Youtube and Twitch so make sure you are following us !</description>
