      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get organised, PiSoc! We&amp;rsquo;ll soon be running our next PiSoc Presents - this time we&amp;rsquo;ll be teaching you about project management and organisation.
Our talk will take place on Monday 11th November, starting at 18:45. We&amp;rsquo;ll be teaching you the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; of Git, Git repository hosts (Github/Gitlab), and Trello.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t already use these tools and services, your projects will greatly benefit from them. They&amp;rsquo;re great for keeping your work organised - as well as displaying it online after the fact.</description>

      <description>Penguin time was fun! Last week, we had a special PiSoc weekly meeting - our very first PiSoc Presents! Our Social Exec, Tom Mitchell, gave a lecture on &amp;ldquo;an introduction to Linux&amp;rdquo;. The talk covered what we mean by &amp;ldquo;Linux as a kernel&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;as an OS&amp;rdquo;, and the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; of Linux-based operating systems.
Incase you missed it, you can view/download the slides here.
We hope you all learned something and enjoyed the free pizza!</description>
