      <description>An upate on the gameathon - we will indeed be having drinks and snacks for free at the event.
We should (all things going to plan) also have two Raspberry Pis to give away as prizes. One will go to the winner of a free-for-all at the begining of the gameathon (so get there on time to participate!), and the other will go to the winner of a tournament we will run over the course of the event.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that PiSoc is holding another gameathon on the 8th of March. It&amp;rsquo;ll be between 2 and about 6:30, in D1.24 (the postgrad research lab). We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing Xonotic, a FOSS Quake 3 Arena/Unreal Tournament clone. If you&amp;rsquo;re intested in fast, twitchy FPS action, come along to our gameathon!
Food and drink may or may not be provided, we&amp;rsquo;re working on that :P</description>
