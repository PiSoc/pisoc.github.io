      <description>PiSoc has yet another event coming up! We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ll be holding a Linux install party on the 16th of October! We&amp;rsquo;ll be in Horton D1.24 between 18:30 and 21:00.
Installing Linux on your personal computer is a great way to get your feet wet with Linux usage, which is a really useful skill to have in the IT industry (something to write on a CV!). If you&amp;rsquo;re taking a CS related course, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used it in the labs by now, and have seen some of the power of Linux.</description>
