      <description>Ever wondered how the internet works? What sort of technology goes into connecting the world?
Where did it all come from, and who invented it?
And just how exactly do all of those cat pictures end up online?
PiSoc is very proud to introduce our first external speaker of the year - Thomas Mangin. Thomas is the Operational and Technical Director at Exa Networks, and has been since he co-founded the company in 2003.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get organised, PiSoc! We&amp;rsquo;ll soon be running our next PiSoc Presents - this time we&amp;rsquo;ll be teaching you about project management and organisation.
Our talk will take place on Monday 11th November, starting at 18:45. We&amp;rsquo;ll be teaching you the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; of Git, Git repository hosts (Github/Gitlab), and Trello.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t already use these tools and services, your projects will greatly benefit from them. They&amp;rsquo;re great for keeping your work organised - as well as displaying it online after the fact.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s penguin time, PiSoc! On 21/10/19 (at the time of writing, the coming Monday), we&amp;rsquo;ll be holding our first PiSoc presents lecture, as well as this semester&amp;rsquo;s Linux Install Party.
PiSoc Presents: Linux 101 Are you interested in Linux, but don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start?
Does the command line confuse you?
Do you want to learn some things and eat free (as in free pizza) pizza?
Starting from 18:15, we&amp;rsquo;ll be delivering a lecture on the fundamentals of Linux-based operating systems, how they work and how to use them.</description>
