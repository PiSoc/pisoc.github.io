      <description>Penguin time was fun! Last week, we had a special PiSoc weekly meeting - our very first PiSoc Presents! Our Social Exec, Tom Mitchell, gave a lecture on &amp;ldquo;an introduction to Linux&amp;rdquo;. The talk covered what we mean by &amp;ldquo;Linux as a kernel&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;as an OS&amp;rdquo;, and the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; of Linux-based operating systems.
Incase you missed it, you can view/download the slides here.
We hope you all learned something and enjoyed the free pizza!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy week. We&amp;rsquo;ve had a awful lot of fun running events for the past week. If you missed out (and we&amp;rsquo;re really sorry if you did!), here&amp;rsquo;s a brief recap of what went on.
Tuesday: Computer Science Induction talks You may have seen our president, Chris Delee, give an &amp;ldquo;intro to PiSoc&amp;rdquo; talk at the induction day event. It covered who we are, what we do, and where you can find us if you want to get involved.</description>
