      <description>PiSoc has yet another event coming up! We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ll be holding a Linux install party on the 16th of October! We&amp;rsquo;ll be in Horton D1.24 between 18:30 and 21:00.
Installing Linux on your personal computer is a great way to get your feet wet with Linux usage, which is a really useful skill to have in the IT industry (something to write on a CV!). If you&amp;rsquo;re taking a CS related course, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used it in the labs by now, and have seen some of the power of Linux.</description>

      <description>PiSoc has yet another event coming up! This time, it&amp;rsquo;s a penetration testing bootcamp. Here you can learn some hacking skills (for ETHICAL USE ONLY). It&amp;rsquo;s taking place on the 25th of March (25/03/17), between 9am and about 6pm. It&amp;rsquo;s an all day affair, so you know it&amp;rsquo;s serious business. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the CS deparment&amp;rsquo;s swanky new pentesting labs, too! No background in cyber security is required, and it&amp;rsquo;s free to all PiSoc members.</description>

      <description>I am pleased to announce that PiSoc will be hosting a Linux install party on the 13th March 2017. During this event we can help you install Linux on your machine. We will also be giving a presentation about Linux where we will be talking about the different Linux distributions as well as how you can customise your machine to your liking. We will be providing snacks and drinks at this event and will be a great chance to relax with your fellow students.</description>

      <description>An upate on the gameathon - we will indeed be having drinks and snacks for free at the event.
We should (all things going to plan) also have two Raspberry Pis to give away as prizes. One will go to the winner of a free-for-all at the begining of the gameathon (so get there on time to participate!), and the other will go to the winner of a tournament we will run over the course of the event.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that PiSoc is holding another gameathon on the 8th of March. It&amp;rsquo;ll be between 2 and about 6:30, in D1.24 (the postgrad research lab). We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing Xonotic, a FOSS Quake 3 Arena/Unreal Tournament clone. If you&amp;rsquo;re intested in fast, twitchy FPS action, come along to our gameathon!
Food and drink may or may not be provided, we&amp;rsquo;re working on that :P</description>
