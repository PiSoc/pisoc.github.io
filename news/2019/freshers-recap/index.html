<h2 id="it-s-been-a-busy-week">It&rsquo;s been a busy week.</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had a awful lot of fun running events for the past week. If you missed out (and we&rsquo;re really sorry if you did!), here&rsquo;s a brief recap of what went on.</p>

<h3 id="tuesday-computer-science-induction-talks">Tuesday: Computer Science Induction talks</h3>

<p>You may have seen our president, Chris Delee, give an &ldquo;intro to PiSoc&rdquo; talk at the induction day event. It covered  who we are, what we do, and where you can find us if you want to get involved. If you didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see the talk, or speak to us during the break/lab session, you can read our 2019 welcome post <a href="https://pisoc.net/news/welcome-freshers-2019/">here</a>. It should bring you up to speed!</p>

<h3 id="wednesday-fresher-s-fayre">Wednesday: Fresher&rsquo;s Fayre</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar, the fresher&rsquo;s fayre is an event the student union holds every year that allows students to explore the available societies and join the ones they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>

<p>We had a blast meeting all of you, talking about what we do, and showing you a few demos on what PiSoc is about. It seems like a lot of you enjoyed the free loot we were giving out!</p>

<p>If you signed up with us at any time on Wednesday, you were entered into a raffle to win an Arduino Nano compatible microcontroller. We had three to give out, and they&rsquo;ve gone to Maryam, Tobias and Mustafa!</p>

<h3 id="thursday-drone-hacking-demo">Thursday: Drone hacking demo</h3>

<p>Everyone likes drones. Everyone likes a cool hack. Everyone likes a bit of competition. This event combined all three! While nobody quite managed to knock our drone out of the sky, some of the teams got very close!</p>

<p>If you enjoyed the event and wanted to learn a bit more about hacking drones, you&rsquo;ll like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CzURm7OpAA">this</a> talk from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON">DEFCON 23</a>.</p>

<h3 id="friday-gameathon">Friday: Gameathon</h3>

<p>Like most nerdy folk, we all enjoy playing some video games. Despite a few technical hitches (one of the games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault">segfaulting</a> at the worst possible time!), the gameathon was great fun. We saw some great play in all three of the tournament and good sportsmanship all around.</p>

<p>The winners are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Xonotic: Paul</li>
<li>Eggnogg+: Daany</li>
<li>Worms: Svetoslav</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above received a Raspberry Pi starter kit and a box chock-full of electronics, perfect for any project you could imagine.</p>

<h3 id="friday-2019-s-first-pisoc-social">Friday: 2019&rsquo;s first PiSoc social</h3>

<p>Those that came along to the gameathon were invited to come out for a (in our opinion, very well deserved) drink with us after to round off the week.</p>

<h3 id="closing-words-from-chris">Closing words from Chris</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It was great to chat to a lot of you during induction day and the fresher&rsquo;s fayre. I would like to welcome you all to PiSoc - UoB&rsquo;s computing society. I hope you all enjoyed the activities we ran during the week, from the intro talks to the gameathon. For those that attended the talk on Tuesday, I hope it was informative and let you know who we are and what we are about. I look forward to meeting you all properly at our sessions on Monday evenings and working with you in future on some of our projects. <strong>~ Chris Delee, PiSoc President</strong></p>
